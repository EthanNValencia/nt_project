        Caroline is a proud mom to three kids, a fitness enthusiast, and is
        extremely passionate about helping women. Caroline’s past experience as
        a patient in Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy helped guide her into
        becoming a professional in the pelvic health field.
      </p>
      <p>
        After treating and talking with lots of women the most common feedback
        she receives is, “Why didn’t someone tell me about this sooner!!” She
        believes giving women (even) basic information, such as what they should
        be doing during pregnancy, labor, post partum and into their “matured”
        years, could potentially change a lot of outcomes for the overall health
        of their body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her goal is to educate women about pelvic health, general movement and
        wellness so they can have a strong healthy body! She believes pain is a
        signal from your body that something is out of balance and encourages
        women to be an advocate for their health. Caroline is looking forward to
        helping you find your solution to have a strong and healthy body!
