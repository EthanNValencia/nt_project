      <h2>Tried Physical Therapy before and think it doesn’t work for you?</h2>
      <p>We don’t know what we don’t know. That’s why we ask questions.</p>
      <p>
        Have a cup of coffee on us and let’s talk about what’s stopping you. We
        want to hear about your limitations, your aches and pains, and your
        goals. We want to answer your questions about PT. What an evaluation
        would look like? What treatments we might use for you? And get a feel
        for who we are. Ultimately, It’s our job to work ourselves out of a job,
        so our Therapy will focus on your personal accountability and long term
        success.

      <p>Don’t stop doing what you love, no matter what your age!</p>
      <p>We’ll have about 20 minutes set aside for you.</p>
